        <p>Standing Out</p>
       <h2>Is it better to stand out or blend in? Am I supposed to do all I can to distinguish myself from others or should I stay hidden and try my hardest not to be singled out? I like being different. I enjoy when the teacher singles me out and when someone describes an action as something I would do. It doesn’t happen often, but when it does I take that moment in. I’m pretty average. Or at least I think myself to be, but at the same time I don’t know how I would define average. Is average blending in? Or is it average to want to stand out? I take minor steps to stand out. I like dressing very nicely even when I don’t need to. I enjoy writing more, the bare minimum is simply not acceptable for me. I enjoy relating things back to my life but then afterwards second guess my decision and wonder if people don’t like that I tend to make situations about me. I try to stand out, to differ myself from the crowd. When will I learn that it is okay to be like everyone else? Even so, I will always try to find ways to stand out and be unique. I am my own person and I hope myself to certain standards because of that. Is that normal to think?
